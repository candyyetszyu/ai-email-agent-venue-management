# Security Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices for the Email Agent application. Following these guidelines will help protect sensitive user data, API credentials, and ensure secure communication between components.

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Security

1. **Secret Key Management**:
   - Use a strong, randomly generated secret key for JWT signing
   - Store the JWT secret in environment variables, never in code
   - Rotate JWT secrets periodically in production

2. **Token Configuration**:
   - Set appropriate expiration times (recommended: 1-24 hours)
   - Include only necessary claims in the payload
   - Implement token refresh mechanisms for longer sessions

3. **Token Validation**:
   - Validate tokens on every protected request
   - Check expiration, signature, and issuer
   - Implement a token blacklist for revoked tokens

### OAuth Security

1. **Provider Configuration**:
   - Use separate OAuth credentials for development and production
   - Restrict redirect URIs to trusted domains only
   - Request only the minimum required scopes

2. **Callback Handling**:
   - Validate state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks
   - Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) when possible
   - Use HTTPS for all OAuth redirects

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

1. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse:
   - Limit requests per IP address
   - Add stricter limits for authentication endpoints
   - Consider different limits for different API endpoints

2. **Response Headers**:
   - Include rate limit information in response headers
   - Provide clear error messages when limits are exceeded

### Input Validation

1. **Validate all user inputs**:
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Validate data types, formats, and ranges
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

2. **API Parameter Validation**:
   - Validate query parameters and request bodies
   - Implement schema validation for JSON payloads
   - Reject requests with unexpected parameters

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **Email Content**:
   - Store email content securely
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Consider encryption for stored email content

2. **User Information**:
   - Minimize collection of personal information
   - Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
   - Implement data retention policies

3. **API Credentials**:
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Use environment variables for all credentials
   - Implement credential rotation policies

### Transport Security

1. **HTTPS Implementation**:
   - Enforce HTTPS for all communications
   - Configure proper SSL/TLS settings
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS automatically

2. **Security Headers**:
   - Implement Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
   - Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Use Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
   - Add X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking

## Third-Party Integrations

### Google and Microsoft APIs

1. **API Scopes**:
   - Request only the minimum required scopes
   - Review and audit scopes periodically
   - Document required scopes clearly

2. **Token Storage**:
   - Store access and refresh tokens securely
   - Never expose tokens to client-side code
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanisms

### OpenAI API

1. **API Key Security**:
   - Store the API key securely in environment variables
   - Never expose the API key to client-side code
   - Set usage limits to prevent unexpected costs

2. **Content Filtering**:
   - Implement content filtering for user inputs
   - Validate AI-generated responses before sending
   - Monitor for potential misuse

## Frontend Security

### React Security

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use npm audit or similar tools to check for vulnerabilities
   - Remove unused dependencies

2. **State Management**:
   - Never store sensitive information in local storage
   - Use secure cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags
   - Clear sensitive data when sessions end

3. **XSS Prevention**:
   - Sanitize user-generated content before rendering
   - Use React's built-in XSS protections
   - Implement Content-Security-Policy headers

## Backend Security

### Node.js Security

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use npm audit to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions for production

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Avoid exposing stack traces in production
   - Log errors securely without sensitive information

3. **Process Management**:
   - Run Node.js with limited privileges
   - Use process managers like PM2
   - Implement graceful shutdown handlers

## Deployment Security

### Environment Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration
   - Never commit .env files to version control
   - Use different values for development and production

2. **Production Hardening**:
   - Disable development features in production
   - Remove debugging tools and endpoints
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring

### Server Hardening

1. **Server Configuration**:
   - Keep server software updated
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Implement a firewall

2. **Container Security** (if using Docker):
   - Use official base images
   - Run containers with non-root users
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities

## Security Monitoring and Response

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **Security Logging**:
   - Log authentication events
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Implement centralized logging

2. **Alerting**:
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Monitor for unusual API usage
   - Implement automated responses for common attacks

### Incident Response

1. **Response Plan**:
   - Develop an incident response plan
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Document steps for common security incidents

2. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Implement backup and restore procedures
   - Document steps to revoke compromised credentials
   - Plan for service restoration after incidents

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection Regulations

1. **GDPR Compliance** (if applicable):
   - Implement data subject access rights
   - Document data processing activities
   - Ensure lawful basis for processing

2. **Privacy Policy**:
   - Develop a clear privacy policy
   - Disclose data collection and usage practices
   - Provide contact information for privacy concerns

## Security Testing

### Vulnerability Assessment

1. **Regular Testing**:
   - Conduct periodic security assessments
   - Use automated scanning tools
   - Consider third-party security audits

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing before major releases
   - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Verify API security controls

## Conclusion

Security is an ongoing process that requires regular attention and updates. By following these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of security incidents and protect sensitive user data in your Email Agent application.

Regularly review and update your security measures as new threats emerge and as the application evolves.
